## Abbreviations :

- **RTT** : Round trip time | Time for a *small* packet to go to destination, then for the *small* response to come back.
  can be used with most of the packet exchanged in an HTTP SEQ-type exercise because MSS is usually small
- **MSS** : Maximum Segment Size | Usually the size of each segment sent in the HTTP SEQ-type exercises, it is dictated
  by network's properties
- **ACK** : Acknowledgement | In response to your request, if it was received, in some exercises can be replaced
  with "**200 OK**" (for example in Message SRC-DEST tables to fill)
- **GBN** : Go-Back-N | The receiver has a window of **size 1**, it's willing to accept only one SEQ at a time and discards
  anything else. Sender retransmits all sent after last ACKed segment, because it knows receiver has discarded them all.
ACKs are **Cumulative** means if there is **ACK 143**, all BITS from 0 to 143 were correctly acknowledged
- **SR** : Selective repeat | Receiver has window size of K, ACKs are **Selective** means that if ACK 10, 
segment 10 has been ACKed. If lost, only the lost segment is retransmitted

### More notes : 
**Queuing delay** : Approaches infinity if bit arrival rate > bit departure rate i.e. if packets are
processed slower than they arrive, is kinda what we call **burstiness** of the arriving packets
(arrival rate / departure rate ratio)

## Miscellaneous notes :

- **Pipelining** : Means technique in which multiple requests are written out to a single socket without waiting for
  the corresponding responses. Implies introduction of sliding window of size N.
  **Contrary of STOP and WAIT** which is send ONE segment and wait for ACK before sending TWO

- **Number of sockets** type of questions : Good rule of thumb is different socket for each
  protocol (UDP, TCP, ETC...) and _also_ different socket for each different server you are communicating with :
  ex: epfl.ch vs ethz.ch

- **Slow start** : Is still exponential ^^
- **Fast retransmit** : Can be very important in HTTP SEQ-type exercises. **Without** : Need timeout to retransmit
  (hence usually takes forever), **With** : Needs 3 (Convention, but can change in some exercises) ACKs with wrong
  SEQ number to retransmit

## Interesting illustrations :

**Context** : Segment one is lost and window size is **N = 5** ([midterm2017-solved], Problem 3, Question 1)
